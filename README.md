# Lab 1: Calling, Building, and Securing APIs
In homework I1 you will use third-party LLM APIs, and in the group project you will develop your own APIs. In this lab you will experiment with both: connecting to one such LLM's (Gemini) API, and providing your own API endpoint. 
To receive credit for this lab, show your work to the TA during recitation.

## Deliverables
- [Done] Retrieve an API Key for Gemini and implement the call to the Gemini API to have the LLM analyze the image in some way. 
- [Done] Run the API endpoint with the Gemini API call implemented and demonstrate that it works using an example invocation.
- [Done] Commit your code without committing your credentials. Explain to the TA why hard-coding credentials is a bad idea, and explain any remedial steps you might take should credentials accidentally be leaked.
